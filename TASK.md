I need bot logic to differentiate between private chat and group chat. So basically it's different between group and private which group will be financial report about that group and private chat is financial report for that group. We can accomodate it using existing database which userid that we will save is the groupid. But for heavy refactoring code is using groupId instead of userId on each chat / command. We can make handler for that using SOLID principles. Then for API and web it should handle the same logic.
