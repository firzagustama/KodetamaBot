I need you to read README.md to get grasp about the application and PROMPT.md for context.

Now i need to update bot flow. When registration just show what this bot can do such as keep track of expense, send invoice image, etc. (current implementation). Then show to user that it's still in beta test. Ask user if they want to be beta tester and keep admin approval flow as is (also set defautl tier to family).

After that when onboarding don't ask such as salary, date salary, and etc. Just show that they can use it with chat like "baju 100rb", "makanan 20rb budget Personal", upload invoice, use voice notes and etc.

Then on the backend side of bot, it will create a budget buckets that is "Unallocated".

Also update the /help command
